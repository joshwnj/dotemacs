Commentary:

  Run Node.js REPL and communicate the process.
  This program is derived from comint-mode and provides the below features.

   * token completion, same as Node.js REPL
   * file name completion in string
   * incremental history search

  Put this file in your Emacs lisp path (e.g. ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp)
  and add to the following lines to your .emacs:

     (require 'nodejs-mode)

  In order to run Node.js REPL, type M-x nodejs.
  See also `comint-mode' to check key bindings, typing M-x help f comint-mode.
