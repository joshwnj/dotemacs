And all those mentioned in the ‘Contributors’ section below.

Please email any bugs or feature requests to `lobbyjones at gmail dot com` or submit them as Issues here on the Github page.  Also please include the output of `php-mode-version` in bug reports.

# Status

**23 December 2011:** These days I am doing less and less PHP programming, and thus work on `php-mode` has slowed down.  However I am still accepting bug reports and feature requests, so please do not consider the project dead.  I have a list of features I would like to add, but right now I am unsure when I will get around to them.  My apologies for the slow updates.

# Features

## New Keywords

Now `php-mode` supports syntax highlighting for new keywords which were added as part of PHP 5.4, e.g. those related to traits, such as `insteadof`.  Also supported are the older keywords `clone` and `default`.

## Constants

Every magic constant and predefined constant listed on the official PHP site is included in syntax highlighted.

## Traits, Interfaces, and Namespaces

Traits, interfaces, and namespaces now appear under Imenu listings.  Fontification works properly for namespaces as well, so that code like `namespace Foo\Bar\Baz` no longer looks like a warning.  This is also true for namespace aliases, e.g. `use <namespace> as <alias>`; currently the aliased name is not listed in Imenu, but that will be addressed in the future.

## Treatment of Underscores

Underscores are treated as ‘symbol constituents’ (in Emacs terminology) so that you can use keys like M-f and M-b to move through the individual parts of a variable name like `$foo_bar_baz`.

## Chained Method Calls

A series of method calls over multiple lines will now be aligned with the `->` operator, e.g.:

    $object->foo()
           ->bar()
           ->baz();

## Nested Array Formatting

Nested function calls and `array()` structures now look better by default (or at least in my opinion).  Here is an example of the style:

    $results = Post::model()->find(
        array(
            'select'    => 'title',
            'condition' => 'postID=:postID',
            'params'    => array(':postID' => 10),
        )
    );

(Note: The alignment of the `=>` operators is not part of these changes.)

## Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions such as

    $greet = function($name) { … };

will now appear on Imenu; in this case the name will be `$greet`.

## Flymake Support

By customizing the variable `php-executable` you can enable Flymake mode in order to see warnings and errors in real-time as you write code.

## Search Local Documentation

The key command `C-c C-f` will search the PHP website for documentation on the word under the cursor.  However, if you have a [local copy of the PHP documentation](http://us2.php.net/download-docs.php) then `php-mode` will try searching that documentation first.  All you need to do is customize the variable `php-manual-path` and give it the path to your copy of the documentation.  If `php-mode` cannot find something locally then it will still fallback on searching the PHP website.

## Executing Regions of PHP

The command `php-send-region`, which is bound to `C-c C-r` by default, will execute the selected region of PHP code.  In conjunction with the Emacs command `C-x h` you can use this to execute an entire file.  Any output will appear in a buffer called `*PHP*`.
