# To do

 * predefined window configurations

 * better contrast on the modeline to distinguish the active window

 * html-mode: search by css-selector
  * could maybe do this with the php-tokens.el plugin, and a phpquery script

 * js-mode: port across the php-tokens.el plugin

 * make a selection and then do something with it
  * search for other instances of the selection
  * comment/uncomment
  * indent/outdent
  * func: store the current selection

 * bookmarks
  * maybe just use the mark ring?

 * fix whitespace mode colours

 * bind caps-lock to ctrl

 * when in fullscreen with only a single window, increase the left/right padding
